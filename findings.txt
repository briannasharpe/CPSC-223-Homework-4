All data:
The curves, for the most part, had a similar shape with a tall curve in the beginning followed by a much smaller curve. The only graph that did not follow this pattern was the first column, the clump thickness.

Correlation:
After comparing many of the columns, they seem to have no correlation at all, as seen by the two columns I chose: size uniformity and shape uniformity. This graph like many of the others looks like checkers spread on a board and had an numerical correlation value of 0.906882. It could be possible that there is a positive correlation due to the small empty space in two of the corners, but it appears to be too spread to confidently conclude as such.

Group by class:
Most of the graphs for class 2 were similar in that there was only one bump near the left, except for clump thickness and bland chromatin, which had more data around that area. For class 4, there was a lot more variation. Many had data that barely went above 0.2 density on the y-axis, which resulted in gentle curves, but others such as clump thickness and bland chromatin were different from the others, just like their class 2 counterparts. Instead of leaning towards the left side of the graph like those in class 2, class 4 leaned more towards the right side. Class 4 values were always lower than class 2 values and had more spread out results along the x-axis.



P.S Thank you for this class, I really enjoyed learning python for the first time and effectively putting everything we learned in class to use in the homeworks and tests.
